<p id="tribute-info">The name "coronavirus" is derived from Latin corona, meaning "crown" or "wreath", 
    itself a borrowing from Greek κορώνη korṓnē, "garland, wreath".[10][11] The name was coined by June Almeida and David Tyrrell 
    who first observed and studied human coronaviruses.[12] The word was first used in print in 1968 
    by an informal group of virologists in the journal Nature to designate the new family of viruses.[9] 
    The name refers to the characteristic appearance of virions (the infective form of the virus) by electron microscopy, 
    which have a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections creating an image reminiscent of the solar corona or halo.[9][12] 
    This morphology is created by the viral spike peplomers, which are proteins on the surface of the virus.[13]

    History
    Coronaviruses were first discovered in the 1930s when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens was shown 
    to be caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).[14] Arthur Schalk and M.C. Hawn described in 1931 a new respiratory 
    infection of chickens in North Dakota. The infection of new-born chicks was characterized by gasping and listlessness. 
    The chicks' mortality rate was 40–90%.[15] Fred Beaudette and Charles Hudson six years later successfully isolated and cultivated 
    the infectious bronchitis virus which caused the disease.[16] In the 1940s, two more animal coronaviruses, 
    mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), were isolated.[17] 
    It was not realized at the time that these three different viruses were related.
